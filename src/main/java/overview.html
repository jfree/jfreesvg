  <b>JFreeSVG</b> is a vector graphics library for the Java(tm) platform
  that allows Java2D drawings to be rendered to Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)
  via a {@link org.jfree.graphics2d.svg.SVGGraphics2D} implementation.  For
  typical usage, see the class description for the <code>SVGGraphics2D</code>
  class and the demo applications included in the JFreeSVG distribution.
  <p>
  In addition, there is an experimental 
  {@link org.jfree.graphics2d.canvas.CanvasGraphics2D} class for translating
  Java2D calls to Javascript HTML5 Canvas API calls.
  <p>  
  <b>JFreeSVG</b> requires Java 6 or later.  For more information, see
